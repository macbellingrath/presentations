* Arc Publishing - "Tools for digital publishers built by The Washington Post"
* [iOSDevCampDC 2018 - Scaling iOS Architecture - Arthur Sabintsev](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bvXx1mbbGOA&t=2198s)
* One partner, needs 1-3 apps, mulitple months per app
...
* One partner needed 40+ apps, released within days of eachother
* We needed to scale, *fast*

---
## the naive approach, how do we build 40+ apps?
* one at a time
* manual
* error prone (submission errors, invalid configuration)
* repetetive and not fun
* no way we'd make our deadline

# `Manual Work is a Bug`
a tale of two system administrators:

-  One: "I'm too busy! The person who made the request can't wait! I have 100 other things to do today! Nobody's allocating time for me to write code!"
- Two: Performs manual work when it produces an `artifact`

---
# mindset

![guage](./gauge.jpg)

`..the successful one had a mindset of always thinking in terms of moving toward the goal of a better automated system.`

---
# [fit] completely manual -> fully autonomous
![guage](./gauge.jpg)

---
# artifact

What is an `artifact`?
_it furthers the goal of automating your task_

* a bulleted list
* a document
* code snippets
* a guide
* a script

---

# [fit] `..if you can't describe the process in writing, you can't automate it.`

---
## four phases of automation
* document the steps
* create automation equivalents 
* create automation
* create self-service and autonomous systems

---
# phase 1: document the steps

---

# phase 1: document the steps

![how to](how-to-in-project-example.png)

## `Automation is putting process into code. A bullet list in a process document is code if it is treated that way.`

---
## phase 2: create automation equivalents - `follow the doc`

`Yes, the process is still being done manually, but now each manual iteration is done by setting variables and pasting lines of commands into the terminal window. Each manual iteration tests the accuracy of the snippets and finds new edge cases, bugs, and better ways of verifying the results.`

---
## phase 3: create automation

`Soon these command-line snippets are turned into longer scripts. Like all good code, this is kept in a source code repository. The artifacts begin looking more like real software.`

## fastlane

* Created by Felix Krause
* Open source project
* Acquired by Twitter, to become a part of Fabric
* 1 1/2 years at Twitter, acquired by Google as part of Fabric dev tools

* Ruby gem
* Fastlane architecture (actions)
* Plugins 
* Support for custom lanes

--- 
## phase 3: automated-ish


```ruby
 desc 'create a new environment for a new application'
  lane :create_env do
    target_name = UI.input("What is the site abbreviation?").upcase
    bundle_id = UI.input("What is the bundle ID?")
    team_id = UI.input("What is the apple developer portal team ID?")

    list_teams
    itc_team_id = UI.input("What is the iTunes Connect Team ID? hint: run fastlane `list_teams` for a list of itc team ids")
    itc_provider = UI.input("what is your itunes connect provider? Different than itunes team id and developer portal team id. Try lane get_itc_provider")
    env_file = File.new(".env.#{target_name.downcase}", "w")

    text = [
     "APP_ID=#{bundle_id}",
     "FASTLANE_ITC_TEAM_ID=#{itc_team_id}",
     "ITC_PROVIDER=#{itc_provider}",
     "NOTIFICATION_EXTENSION_ID=#{bundle_id}.UrbanAirshipNotificationServiceExtension",
     "TARGET_NAME=#{target_name}",
     "TEAM_ID=#{team_id}"
   ].join("\n")

    env_file.puts(text)
    env_file.close
    UI.success("created environtment for #{target_name}")
  end
```

## phase 3: create automation

```ruby
  desc "Verifies Project Build Settings"
  lane :verify_target do |options|
    begin
      check_env
      project = get_project

      # find app target and extension target
      target = get_app_target(project)
      extension_target = get_extension_target(project)

      target = UI.select("Select a target", project.targets) unless target != nil
      extension_target = UI.select("Select extension target", project.targets) unless extension_target != nil

      # verify plist
      plist_path = get_plist_path(target)
      plist = get_plist(plist_path)

      check_plist_for_required_values(plist)

      # verify that target has required capabilities enabled
      capabilities = system_capabilities(project, target)
      check_system_capabilities(capabilities)
      ....
