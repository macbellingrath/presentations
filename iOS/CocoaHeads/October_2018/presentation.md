a tale of two system administrators:

-  One: "I'm too busy! The person who made the request can't wait! I have 100 other things to do today! Nobody's allocating time for me to write code!"
- Two: Performs manual work when it produces an `artifact`

# The artifact

What is an `artifact`?
_it furthers the goal of automating your task_

* a bulleted list
* a document
* code snippets
* a guide

---

# Mindset

`..the successful one had a mindset of always thinking in terms of moving toward the goal of a better automated system.`

*Automation is putting process into code. A bullet list in a process document is code if it is treated that way.*

---
# A reflection on manual developer work


`..if you can't describe the process in writing, you can't automate it.`
